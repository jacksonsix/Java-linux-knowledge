I am reviewing your request and need some clarifications around the information provided for the ID.

Could you please give me a quick call when you have a couple of minutes?

Thanks,




Per my calculations, I will be working & charging 152 hours (not 168 per your table) – this is for 19 days @ 8 hours a day ( weekends + 26,27,28, = 12 days not included).

Hope this makes sense.  Please let me know if your calculations are different.  Anything and everything works for me just fine.

Thanks,




We have the first ID submitted via our portal!

Congrats, Team!

Thanks for your time in walking thru and submitting an ACF2 request to access the MQ host application.

Please be guided by the email from Brad re: creating the ACF2 IDs for PAT & PROD.

As soon as these hit my queue, I will have them forwarded to the ACF2 team for provisioning.

Merry Christmas & a very happy new Year 2017!

Good morning.

We perfectly understand your position, and thank you for resubmitting the D2-TDBFG ticket with the endpoint changed to 'AD' – we will provision this as soon as approved by your Functional Manager or your Functional Manager's manager (the 1 up manager to the functional manager will be able to see the ticket in their approval queue and approve it during the functional manager's absence).

I also note that you have not submitted a ticket for your access to the 'PAT' environment (Domain: P-TDBFG) – you may submit a ticket for this if this is also required.

Thanks for your patience and understanding,



Please resubmit your request changing the endpoint to 'AD' as shown in the screenshot below:

Please note that I am have to 'Reject' the current ticket due to this inconsistency.

This is a known HR issue for incoming/onboarding new employees. HR data is not being updated in the HR system and employee's Peoplesoft profiles are incomplete.  Only when the HR data has been setup correctly, and the HR system has propagated those changes, will our NPID portal database feed display a user's login ID.

Contact HR 1-844-ASKTDHR (1-844-275-8347) to inquire if ACF2 ID was populated and completed via the PeopleSoft profile. 

Thank you and Best Regards,



Could you please call me when you have a chance to discuss your ID request in the NPID Portal?
