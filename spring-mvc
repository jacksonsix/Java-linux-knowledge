System.getProperty() gets a property as defined by the JVM (either the JVM itself or any -D options you may have passed at the command line).
The list of defined properties can be found here (thanks @NikitaBeloglazov).

properties.getProperty() is the result of someone having initialized an object of type Properties.
They are not the same, though you can get what System has as a Properties instance.

A Properties object is very often the result of loading a Java property file (see here for how this is done)
