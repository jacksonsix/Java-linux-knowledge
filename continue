I was slightly confused by the ID referred to in the email chain.  The ID was resubmitted as SIXCB_APP_ORA (not SIX_APP_ORA), and this ID is with the provisioning team for action.

Hope this helps.

Thanks,





Good morning.
 
Please request Sean to get in touch with me for assistance to complete the form for the NPID.
 
Thanks,




If the named executive is away, the named executive's one-up will be able to see the ticket and approve.  If both are away, then there is no option but to wait for one of them to return.

Unfortunately, the portal does not accept email approvals.

Hope this is helpful.

Thanks,





This ID is awaiting being provisioned by the team:  ITS-TCO-IAM-Request Management <ITS-TCO-IAM-RequestManagement@td.com>

I have reached out to a team member for the status – will loop you in as soon as I have an update.

Thanks,




Good morning.

First off, I apologize for the delay in responding; we have been experiencing a more than usual volume of requests for NPID-IDs via the new NPID Portal.

I agree with Kristijan, that these are not questions for and to be answered by NPID.  That said, we could provide a few pointers, which please take into account making sure to use your best practice policies for NPID-ID Ownership.

Normally, the Project team submits requests for the NPID under their own Cost center – this is in the interest of the project and the urgency to get the IDs for development / testing and migration to production.  Eventually, when the project is ready to be handed over to a business function / segment, the Project team requests for a change of ownership (CC Change) for the NPIDs created for the project.  The business owners accept the ownership and the risk and are accountable for the IDs from that point on.

Hope this makes sense.  Please note however, that this is only a pointer to be used with your discretion and judgment.

Thanks & regards,






Creation of IDs for users in the lower environments is now handled via the new NPID Portal.

If you could please give me a call, I can walk you through the process; it should not take more than 3 minutes.

Thanks,




Please request Sean to get in touch with me for assistance to complete the form for the NPID.

Thanks,





Good morning.  Sorry to have missed your message on Friday.  
Please feel free to call me anytime you are in office today.
Thanks,





When someone needs to create an ID for accessing a server in the Cloud (via SSH), then redirect them to the Cloud Ops Team: CloudOps@td.com is the DL for the Cloud team....they handle all the requests through their own process.....
Cloud related IDs are not created through NPID Portal....

Thanks,




The name of the new ID created by Shah for this purpose is: 'tesgi01' – please use this ID in you correspondences.

The ID was approved by the NPID Team and is currently with the Provisioning team – you may please contact the team using the DL:  ITS-TCO-IAM-Request Management <ITS-TCO-IAM-RequestManagement@td.com>.

If I may be of any further assistance, please do let me know.

Thanks,




Thanks to Shah's spontaneous assistance, we have submitted a request which after acceptance by the CC Owner, I will push through the provisioning team and enable you to meet your dead-line of 12/19/2016.

Thanks for your patience and understanding,





Great morning.

Could you please let me know that status re: the UNIX ID – 'tesgi01' – the PM is on my case!

Sorry to bother you, my friend.

Thanks as ever,



Please call me when you have some time….

Thanks,







We have received the three tickets that you have submitted via the NPID Portal.  On reviewing the tickets, we need a few clarifications from you, especially the name of the IDs.

Could you please call me when you have a little time?

Thanks,





Per my calculations, I will be working & charging 152 hours (not 168 per your table) – this is for 19 days @ 8 hours a day ( weekends + 26,27,28, = 12 days not included).

Hope this makes sense.  Please let me know if your calculations are different.  Anything and everything works for me just fine.

Thanks,





Simply Brilliant work, Jason & Sam…..this makes the portal really super!

Thanks,





The way to go, Sam!  Way to go, Jason!

Super work during a very stressful situation!

We are proud of you guys!

Keep rocking!

Best,





It’s a celebration of your coming back to the team!  I'm in!

Thanks for the thought!

Best,





Yes!  Great idea!  I'm in! Anyone of the days is OK with me.

Thanks, Ernesto…

Best,





Looks good, Ivan.  Good job, Soody!

I cannot think of anything immediately to add to whatever has been written.

Best,






Sure, Ernesto…fine with me!

Have a fine day!

Best,




First off, please accept our apologies for standing you up and not joining the call…..something important came up and we had to have discussions with Ivan Flowerday to get a resolution / closure/direction for the way forward in our project.  We appreciate your understanding.

That said, this does not absolve us of the fact that we did not join the important weekly update call…we shall make sure that this is not repeated in future.

Have a great week-end,

Best regards,





When attempting to process the TDBFG records, I observed that the number of records have been truncated at 65,536.  The reason for this is because the extract was done to an '.xls' file (2003 version of Excel has this limitation on the number of rows).  This issue can easily be remediated if you could kindly to the import to either '.xlsx' or '.csv' or '.txt' formats.

I am proceeding to work on the new extract for BKNG, which is a much smaller file and would not have this issue.

Thanks & regards,





Sure, we can get this done.

Best,





I have received the following communication from PwC requesting PwC staff & contractors to take a day off on July 29, 2016, as it is a holiday for PwC.

Please let me know if this is OK with you.

Have a great Friday and a good week-end,

Best,
